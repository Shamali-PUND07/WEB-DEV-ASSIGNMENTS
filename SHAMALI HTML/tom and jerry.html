  <h2>1. A Long-Lasting Legacy</h2>

 <img src="T5.jpg" width="200px" height="250px" >
   <p><b><i>Tom and Jerry premiered in 1940, created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Over 80 years later, the series is still beloved and continues to be a part of pop culture. It has won several Academy Awards and has been adapted into numerous versions, including TV specials and movies.</i></b></p>

  <h2>2. The Show’s Name is a Bit Misleading</h2>
  <img src="T8.jpg"width="200px" height="350px">
<p><b><i>Despite the title of the show, Tom (the cat) and Jerry (the mouse) aren't the only main characters. There are several other recurring characters in the show, including Spike the bulldog, Butch the cat, and others, who help to make the chase even more exciting.</i></b></p>
<HR>

    <h2>3. Minimal Dialogue</h2>
    <img src="T4.jpg"width="200px" height="250px">
<p><b><i>One of the unique aspects of Tom and Jerry is that the series rarely features spoken dialogue. The humor and storytelling are carried almost entirely through visual gags, exaggerated facial expressions, and creative sound effects. This makes the show universally understandable and accessible, regardless of language or culture.</i></b></p>

<h2>
    4. The Characters’ First Appearance
</h2>
<img src="T6.jpg" height="250px">

<p><b><i>Tom (originally named "Jasper") and Jerry made their first appearance in the animated short Puss Gets the Boot (1940). It wasn't until later that they became the famous characters we know today. The short was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.</i></b></p>
<hr>

<H2>5. The Show’s Golden Age</H2>
<img src="T3.jpg" height="250px">

<p><b><i> The original Tom and Jerry shorts were produced between 1940 and 1958. During this period, the series won 7 Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film. These early episodes are considered to be some of the greatest animated shorts ever made.</i></b></p>
<hr>


<h2>6. The Music Makes a Difference</h2>

<img src="T4.jpg" height="340px">
<p><b><i>
    The soundtracks in Tom and Jerry are a key part of what makes the show so fun. Many of the cartoons were scored by Scott Bradley, whose music is known for its fast-paced, playful nature, matching the chaotic action on screen. The music helped to elevate the humor and add a layer of emotion to the antics.</i></b></p>
<hr>

<h2>7. Inspiration from Silent Films</h2>
<img src="T10.jpg" height="300px">
<p><b><i>
    Hanna and Barbera drew a lot of inspiration from silent film comedians like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. The slapstick comedy, visual gags, and exaggerated reactions are all reminiscent of the physical comedy that dominated silent films.
</i></b></p>
<hr>

<h2>8. Tom’s Name Change</h2>
<img src="T11.jpg" height="300px">
<p><b><i> 
    In the earlier episodes, Tom was referred to as "Jasper" and was later renamed to "Tom" in later episodes, which stuck. The change made the character seem a bit more personable and familiar, helping the audience connect more with him.</i></b></p>
<hr>

<h2>9. Over 160 Episodes</h2>
<img src="T9.jpg" height="230px" >

<p><b><i>  
    There are more than 160 Tom and Jerry animated shorts created between 1940 and 1967. The series became one of the longest-running animated franchises of all time.</i></b></p>
<hr>

<h2> 10. The Cat and Mouse Formula Works</h2>

<img src="T7.jpg" height="290px" >
<p><b><i>
   
While Tom and Jerry have fought each other in almost every episode, they are rarely shown to actually hate each other. The dynamic between them is often more like a "frenemy" relationship, as they are usually just caught up in situations that escalate into chaotic, yet funny, chases.
